# Resume Generator

This resume generator framework allows you to put your resume 
in a configuration file. The framework will then take this configuration file
and generate a PDF file from it. 

In contrast to GUI based resume editors, you don't need any software other than
a text editor. The objective is to be able to put your resume in git and generate 
your resume by triggering a CI/CD pipeline. This way you can alter your resume 
anywhere you'd like, as long as you have access to a browser.

A few advantages:
* Your resume in Git, so you have all the good stuff of Git
* Easily comment out parts of your resume, just like code. So you don't have to 
  save the erased part somewhere else
* Easily change the layout and template without affecting resume contents
